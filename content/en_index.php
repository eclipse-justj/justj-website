  <h1><?php print $eclipse_justj;?></h1>
  <p>
  <b><?php print $simple_justj;?></b> provides fully-functional Java runtimes that can be redistributed by Eclipse Projects.
  The form in which these are made available is intended to make these easily consumable. 
  As such, the Java runtimes will be available via p2 repositories as well as via direct packaged downloads. 
  The links for these will evolve over time. 
  The sources of these Java runtimes are any and all versions approved by the Eclipse Foundation for such purposes. 
  Currently that is limited to the latest release available via <a href="https://jdk.java.net" target="jdk.java.net">https://jdk.java.net</a>.
